# Backup script using rclone
# Anton Lindström (anton at antonanton.com) 2017-09-21
#
# This script syncs LOCAL_CURRENT_DIR to REMOTE:REMOTE_CURRENT_DIR
# This operation makes the contents of REMOTE:REMOTE_CURRENT_DIR identical to LOCAL_CURRENT_DIR
# Before any file is changed or removed from REMOTE:REMOTE_CURRENT_DIR it will be copied to REMOTE:REMOTE_BACKUP_DIR
# REMOTE:REMOTE_BACKUP_DIR gets created if it does not already exist
#
# This backup script is meant to be scheduled to run daily.
